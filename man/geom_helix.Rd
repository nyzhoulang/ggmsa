\usage{
geom_helix(helix_data, color_by = "length", overlap = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{helix_data}{a data frame. The file of nucleltide secondary structure and then read by ggmsa::readSSfile.}

\item{color_by}{generate colors for helices by various rules, including integer counts and value ranges one of "length" and "value"}

\item{overlap}{Logicals. If TRUE, two structures data called predict and known must be given(eg:heilx_data = list(known = data1, predicted = data2)), plots the predicted helices that are known on top, predicted helices that are not known on the bottom, and finally plots unpredicted helices on top in black.}

\item{...}{additional parameter}
}
\value{
ggplot2 layers
}
\description{
The layer of helix plot
