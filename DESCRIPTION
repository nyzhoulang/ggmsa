Description:  A visual exploration tool for multiple sequence alignment and associated data. 
              Supports MSA of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences using 'ggplot2'. 
              Multiple sequence alignment can easily be combined with other 'ggplot2' plots, 
              such as phylogenetic tree produced by 'ggtree', boxplot, genome map and so on. 
              More features:visualization of sequence logos, sequence bundles, RNA secondary structures and detection of sequence recombinations.
